# **Full Stack Dev Test**

### **⏱️ Time Expectation**

A skilled full stack developer should be able to complete this in from **a few hours to 1 day.** Using AI tools are allowed.

# **🎯 Goal**

Build a simple **text-to-speech web app** where a user can:

1. Enter text in **English**.
2. Select a target or multiple language(s) (at least 3–5 options).
3. Translate the text into that language.
4. Generate speech for the translated text.
5. Play the audio in the browser.
- The app must be **fully deployed** (we should be able to open a link in the browser and use it without setup).

## **🛠️ Requirements**

- Must use **Laravel**

## **🆓 Bonus / Extra Features (optional, show off your skills)**

- Option to **download the generated audio file**.
- **Change voice settings** (e.g., male/female, pitch, speed, or different TTS voices).
- Show a **history of past translations/speeches** stored in MySQL.
- Clean, modern UI (Bootstrap/Tailwind).
- Error handling (e.g., show a friendly message if an API fails).
- Whatever feature you think would make the application better.
